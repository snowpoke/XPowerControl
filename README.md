This program shows you how many points you'll be winning/losing in X Rank Splatoon matches, while you're playing.

It's fairly complicated to set up and I currently don't have the time or energy to give proper support for users.
However, here's a Discord server I opened up where you can support each other: https://discord.gg/cPZayQDYDz

I recommend using this program in conjunction with `splatnet_ping.exe`! https://github.com/snowpoke/splatnet-ping

## About this code
This was my first bigger project after coming back to programming, and my first time writing a bigger project in C++.
The code ... reflects that situation üçù (For real though, I tried my best to write clean code, but there are a lot of modern coding standards that I had no idea about back then)
